# npm resolution error report

While resolving: monorepo-expo-rn-ssr-csr@0.1.0
Found: @types/react@19.1.17
node_modules/@types/react
  dev @types/react@"~19.1.10" from the root project

Could not resolve dependency:
peer @types/react@"^19.2.0" from @types/react-dom@19.2.2
node_modules/@types/react-dom
  dev @types/react-dom@"^19.0.2" from the root project

Fix the upstream dependency conflict, or retry
this command with --force or --legacy-peer-deps
to accept an incorrect (and potentially broken) dependency resolution.
